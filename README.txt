This is a simple Java chatroom based off of Java server sockets I made a couple of years ago and never uploaded. It is an upgrade from an older version I wrote, updating it to use JFrames extensively and build a GUI through Java\'92s swing libraries. Unfortunately I never had an opportunity to finish it.}
